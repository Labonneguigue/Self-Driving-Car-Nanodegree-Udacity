# Self-Driving-Car Nanodegree @ Udacity

Here is my collection of repositories containing my solution to each SDCND projects.

## 📚 Term 1 - Computer Vision & Deep Learning

The first term was focused on Computer Vision and Convolutional Neural Networks. Having experience in Machine Learning before the start of this program

### ✏️ Project 1 - Lane Lines Detection

[Description of the project.](https://labonneguigue.github.io/CarND-LaneLines-P1/)

### ✏️ Project 2 - Traffic Sign Classifier

[Project is that way.](https://labonneguigue.github.io/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project/)

### ✏️ Project 3 - Behavior Cloning

[Project writeup right here.](https://labonneguigue.github.io/CarND-Behavioral-Cloning-P3/)

### ✏️ Project 4 - Advanced Lane Finding

[Project.](https://labonneguigue.github.io/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines/)

### ✏️ Project 5 - Vehicle Detection & Tracking

[Project.](https://labonneguigue.github.io/CarND-Vehicle-Detection/)

## 📚 Term 2 - Sensor Fusion, Control and Localization

The second term of this NanoDegree was focused on **Sensor Fusion**, **Control** and **Localization**. I believe that these are the domains that are crucial today to develop ADAS systems that are going to increase driving safety significantly.

### ✏️ Project 6 - Extended Kalman Filter

The Kalman Filters course was a great reminder from University. After the Extended Kalman Filter lesson, I applied one to the Sensor Fusion problem that face AVs. To navigate an uncertain and always evolving environment, AVs must receive data from  different sensors types which are complementary to each other. The sensors provide data in different formats and each have their advantages and drawbacks.

[Have a look at that project writeup  here.](https://labonneguigue.github.io/CarND-Extended-Kalman-Filter-Project/)

### ✏️ Project 7 - Unscented Kalman Filter


[More about my implementation of the UKF here.](https://labonneguigue.github.io/CarND-Unscented-Kalman-Filter-Project/)

### ✏️ Project 8 - Kidnapped Vehicle

[Project.](https://labonneguigue.github.io/CarND-Kidnapped-Vehicle-Project/)

### ✏️ Project 9 - PID Controller

[Project.](https://labonneguigue.github.io/CarND-PID-Control-Project/)

### ✏️ Project 10 - Model Predictive Control

[Project.](https://labonneguigue.github.io/CarND-MPC-Project/)
